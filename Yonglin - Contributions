During this milestone, I was mainly responsible for data acquisition, documentation, and data cleaning. I implemented the full acquisition workflow in Google Colab, where I downloaded the USDA Food Environment Atlas and CDC PLACES datasets and generated SHA-256 checksums to verify the integrity of the downloaded files. I also wrote both the main README.md and the data/README.md to document our directory structure, naming conventions, acquisition steps, and the complete cleaning workflow.

For data cleaning, I processed both datasets in OpenRefine by filtering the relevant variables, validating FIPS codes, removing invalid or non-county rows, standardizing formats, and exporting the final cleaned datasets that are now stored in data/processed/. I uploaded all related notebooks, scripts, cleaned datasets, and the OpenRefine history files to GitHub to ensure transparency and reproducibility across the entire workflow. In addition, Richard and I jointly reviewed the ethical considerations, licensing terms, and usage restrictions for both datasets to ensure our project complies with federal data policies and the requirements of IS477.
