During this milestone, I was mainly responsible for data acquisition, documentation, and data cleaning.

I implemented the full acquisition workflow in Google Colab, including downloading both the USDA Food Environment Atlas and CDC PLACES datasets and generating SHA-256 checksum verifications to ensure data integrity.

For data cleaning, I processed both datasets in OpenRefine by filtering the relevant variables, validating FIPS codes, removing invalid or non-county rows, standardizing formats, and exporting the final cleaned outputs.

I also wrote the top-level README.md and data/README.md to document the directory structure, acquisition workflow, naming conventions, and data cleaning steps.

Additionally, I uploaded all notebooks, scripts, cleaned datasets, and OpenRefine histories to GitHub to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

Lastly, Richard and I jointly reviewed the ethical and licensing considerations for both datasets to ensure compliance with project guidelines.
