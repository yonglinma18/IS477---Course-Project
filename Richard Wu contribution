During this milestone, I focused mainly on the data integration and the final preparation of our merged dataset. I completed the full integration workflow in Google Colab by merging the cleaned USDA and CDC datasets using the standardized FIPS identifiers. After performing the merge, I used OpenRefine to resolve duplicate column names generated during the integration process and to clean and reorganize the final schema so that it was consistent with our naming conventions and ready for analysis. I also uploaded the integration notebook and related files to GitHub to keep our workflow transparent and reproducible. In addition to the technical work, I reviewed the status report to ensure that the information was accurate and aligned with our actual progress. Finally, I worked together with Yonglin to complete the ethical and licensing review for both datasets, making sure that our data sources complied with public-domain requirements and the guidelines of IS477.
